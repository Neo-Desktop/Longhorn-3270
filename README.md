### Note
This is mostly for educational purposes only
Documentation is non-existent

If you're interested in how I black-box tested the original samples, checkout [tree/blackbox](/tree/blackbox "the blackbox branch")

I just /really/ enjoy taking things apart and trying to put them back together

If this helps someone, sweet!

Keep on hacking
